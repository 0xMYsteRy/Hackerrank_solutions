# Hackerrank_solutions
I'm trying to solve all easy and medium questions in Hackerrank. This repository contains my solutions to these questions in Hackerrank. I will also add comments to explain my ideas. Hope that helps.

Since I've just started so there're only a few solutions. I will try to finish the questions as soon as possible. I may also ran into some question I can't solve, but I will learn the knowledge I need and eventually solve it, instead of skipping it. 

Discussions are extremely welcomed!
